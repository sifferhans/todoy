# Todoy - A simple todo app for today

This is a simple todo app created with SvelteKit, where the todo list is reset every day.
It is a fully functioning Progressive Web App, and you can try it out [here](https://todoyapp.netlify.app/).

## Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
```

## Developing

Once you've installed the dependencies with `npm install`, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To build the app, run the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`.
